Quando o cliente diz que a parcela está cara, NÃO discuta o valor. Em vez disso:

1. VALIDE a preocupação: "Entendo sua preocupação com o valor mensal."

2. REFRAME para o benefício: "Mas pense assim: você está pagando pelo seu carro sem juros. Num financiamento, essa mesma parcela te daria um carro bem menor."

3. COMPARE com alternativas: "Quanto você pagaria de aluguel por esse carro? Provavelmente mais do que a parcela do consórcio, e no final você não teria nada."
