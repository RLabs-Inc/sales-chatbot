**Correção Anual pelo IPCA - Proteção para você e seu crédito**

**Como funciona:**
O crédito e as mensalidades são corrigidos anualmente de acordo com o **Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo (IPCA)**.

**Quando acontece a primeira correção:**
A 1ª correção ocorre na **14ª parcela**.

**Por que isso é BOM para você:**

✅ **Seu crédito se mantém atualizado** - Se a inflação subir, seu poder de compra é preservado. O carro que você quer hoje continuará ao seu alcance.

✅ **Parcela e crédito crescem juntos** - O aumento da parcela é proporcional ao aumento do crédito. Você não perde poder de compra.

✅ **IPCA é o índice oficial** - É o mesmo usado pelo governo para medir a inflação real. É transparente e previsível.

**Na prática:** Se o IPCA for de 5% no ano, tanto seu crédito quanto sua parcela serão reajustados em 5%. Você continua podendo comprar o mesmo carro que planejou.
