## O que é Consórcio de Automóveis?

O consórcio é uma modalidade de **compra programada** onde um grupo de pessoas se une com o mesmo objetivo: adquirir um veículo. Cada participante paga parcelas mensais, e todo mês alguns membros do grupo são contemplados e recebem sua carta de crédito para comprar o carro.

A grande diferença para o financiamento bancário: **não há cobrança de juros**. Você paga apenas uma taxa de administração, que é diluída ao longo das parcelas.

Pense assim: em vez de pegar dinheiro emprestado de um banco (e pagar juros por isso), você entra em um grupo de pessoas que estão juntando dinheiro juntas. Todo mês, parte desse dinheiro vai para quem for sorteado ou quem der o maior lance.
