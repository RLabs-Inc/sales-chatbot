Existem **duas formas** de ser contemplado e receber seu crédito para comprar o carro:

### 1. Sorteio Mensal
Todo mês acontecem **assembleias** onde cotas são sorteadas. É pura sorte - você pode ser contemplado no primeiro mês ou ao longo do plano. O importante: **todo mundo é contemplado até o final do prazo**.

### 2. Lance
Quer antecipar? Você pode **ofertar um lance** - um valor extra que você está disposto a pagar. Quem dá o maior lance (em percentual do crédito) é contemplado naquela assembleia.

**Dica estratégica:** Muitos clientes juntam dinheiro nos primeiros meses e dão um lance forte. Outros preferem esperar o sorteio com calma. Ambas as estratégias funcionam!

### E o FGTS?
**Sim, você pode usar o FGTS** para dar lances ou complementar o valor do crédito na compra de veículos novos. É uma excelente forma de acelerar sua contemplação.
