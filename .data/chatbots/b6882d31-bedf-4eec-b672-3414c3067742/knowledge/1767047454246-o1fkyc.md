**Não tem dinheiro para dar lance? Temos soluções!**

O plano Contempla + Master oferece opções flexíveis para quem quer ser contemplado mais rápido:

**Lance Embutido de 15%:**
- Você pode usar até 15% do seu próprio crédito como lance
- Não precisa tirar dinheiro do bolso
- Exemplo: Em um crédito de R$ 70.000, você pode dar lance de até R$ 10.500 usando o próprio crédito

**Parcelamento do Lance em 4x sem juros:**
- Divida o valor do lance em 4 parcelas
- Sem cobrança de juros
- ⚠️ **Importante:** O crédito só fica disponível após a quitação da 4ª parcela do lance

**Diluição do Lance nas Parcelas:**
- Possibilidade de diluir 100% do lance nas parcelas vincendas
- O valor do lance é distribuído nas parcelas restantes

**Parcelas Antecipadas como Lance:**
- Parcelas pagas antecipadamente de forma espontânea podem ser usadas como lance
- Uma forma inteligente de acumular valor para contemplação
