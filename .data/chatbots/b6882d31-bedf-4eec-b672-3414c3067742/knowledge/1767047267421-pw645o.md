## Por que Consórcio em vez de Financiamento?

**A matemática é simples:** no financiamento, você paga juros sobre juros. No consórcio, você paga apenas uma taxa de administração fixa.

### O que você paga no consórcio:
- **Taxa de administração** (10%) - diluída em todas as parcelas
- **Fundo de reserva** - pequeno valor que é **devolvido ao final** se não for usado

### O que você NÃO paga:
- Juros compostos
- IOF
- Taxas bancárias surpresa

**Resultado prático:** As parcelas são significativamente menores que um financiamento tradicional para o mesmo valor de crédito. Um carro de R$ 80.000 financiado pode custar R$ 130.000 no final. No consórcio, você paga R$ 88.000 (crédito + taxa de administração).
