### O processo:
1. Você solicita o cancelamento
2. Sua cota vai para a **assembleia de desistentes**
3. Quando sua cota for sorteada nessa assembleia, você recebe os valores pagos

### O que é descontado:
- Taxa de administração proporcional ao período que participou

### Importante saber:
- Você **não perde tudo** - recebe de volta o que pagou (menos a taxa proporcional)
- O prazo para receber depende do sorteio na assembleia de desistentes
- É diferente de financiamento, onde desistir pode significar perder o bem

**Minha recomendação:** O consórcio é melhor para quem pode se comprometer com o plano. Mas se a vida mudar, existe sim uma porta de saída. Não é imediata, mas seu dinheiro não fica perdido.
