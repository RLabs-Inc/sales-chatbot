## "E se eu nunca for sorteado?"

Essa é uma preocupação comum, mas veja como funciona:

**A garantia:** Ao final do prazo do consórcio, **todos os participantes são contemplados**. Não existe a possibilidade de você pagar tudo e não receber seu crédito.

**Enquanto espera:**
- Você participa de **todos os sorteios mensais** - são várias chances
- Pode **ofertar lances** quando quiser para antecipar
- Seu crédito é **atualizado** para manter o poder de compra

**Estatística real:** A maioria dos consorciados é contemplada antes da metade do plano, seja por sorteio ou lance.

**Pense assim:** O consórcio é para quem quer economizar e pode planejar. Se você precisa do carro para amanhã, talvez precise considerar outras opções. Mas se pode esperar alguns meses com possibilidade de sorteio, a economia é muito significativa.
