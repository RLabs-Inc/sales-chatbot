**Como Funciona a Parcela Reduzida (70% do Crédito):**

O grande diferencial deste plano é a **flexibilidade**. Funciona assim:

**Antes da contemplação:**
- Você paga parcelas calculadas sobre **70% do crédito contratado**
- Exemplo: Contratou R$ 35.000? Paga parcelas sobre R$ 24.500 (R$ 432,47/mês)
- A taxa de administração também é cobrada sobre os 70%

**No momento da contemplação, você escolhe:**

**Opção 1 - Usar 70% do crédito:**
- Recebe R$ 24.500 (no exemplo acima)
- Parcela continua R$ 432,47
- Ideal para quem quer um carro mais em conta

**Opção 2 - Usar 100% do crédito:**
- Recebe R$ 35.000 (crédito integral)
- Parcela é recalculada para o valor integral
- A diferença das parcelas pagas anteriormente é diluída nas parcelas restantes
- Taxa de administração também recalculada sobre o valor integral

**Resumo:** Você começa pagando menos e decide o valor final só quando for contemplado!
