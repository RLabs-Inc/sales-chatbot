**Reajuste do Crédito e Parcelas - Proteção contra inflação**

O consórcio Yamaha utiliza o IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo) para reajustar crédito e parcelas. Isso é uma **proteção para você**:

**Como funciona:**
- O crédito e as mensalidades são corrigidos **anualmente**
- A primeira correção acontece apenas na **14ª parcela**
- Isso significa que você tem mais de 1 ano de parcelas fixas no início

**Proteção extra - Teto de 10%:**
- Mesmo que a inflação acumulada ultrapasse 10%, o reajuste está **limitado a 10%**
- Essa trava protege você de aumentos muito grandes

**Por que o reajuste é importante?**
- Seu crédito também é corrigido, mantendo o poder de compra
- Sem correção, você poderia ser contemplado e o valor não comprar mais o carro desejado
- O reajuste equilibra: parcela sobe um pouco, mas crédito também aumenta

**Na prática:** Se a inflação acumulada for de 5% ao ano, seu crédito de R$ 60.000 passaria para R$ 63.000, e a parcela acompanha proporcionalmente. Você paga um pouco mais, mas pode comprar mais também.
