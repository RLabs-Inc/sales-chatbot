**O que acontece no momento da contemplação?**

Quando você for contemplado, terá liberdade de escolha entre duas opções:

**OPÇÃO 1 - Manter os 70% (Crédito Reduzido):**
- Utiliza 70% do crédito contratado
- Parcela permanece calculada sobre o crédito reduzido
- Taxa de administração continua sendo cobrada sobre os 70%
- Ideal para quem encontrou um veículo que cabe nesse valor

**OPÇÃO 2 - Usar 100% (Crédito Integral):**
- Utiliza o valor total do crédito contratado
- A parcela é recalculada para 100%
- A diferença das parcelas já pagas (entre 70% e 100%) será diluída nas parcelas restantes
- Taxa de administração passa a ser calculada sobre o crédito integral
- Ideal para quem quer usar todo o poder de compra

**Importante:** A decisão só precisa ser tomada no momento da contemplação. Você contrata com parcela reduzida e decide depois, com calma, qual opção faz mais sentido para sua situação.
