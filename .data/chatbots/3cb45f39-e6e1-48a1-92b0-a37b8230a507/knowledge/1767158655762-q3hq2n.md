**Reajuste do Crédito e das Parcelas:**

O consórcio é corrigido pelo **IPCA (Índice Nacional de Preços ao Consumidor Amplo)** - o índice oficial de inflação do Brasil.

**Como funciona:**
- Crédito e mensalidades são corrigidos **anualmente**
- A **1ª correção** acontece na **14ª parcela**
- Depois disso, correção anual

**Proteção importante - Teto de 10%:**
- A correção está **limitada a 10%** por ano
- Mesmo que o IPCA acumulado ultrapasse 10%, você paga no máximo esse limite
- Isso protege você de aumentos muito grandes

**Por que isso é bom:**
- O IPCA corrige tanto o crédito quanto a parcela
- Seu poder de compra é mantido - quando for contemplado, o crédito acompanhou a valorização dos carros
- O teto de 10% dá previsibilidade ao seu planejamento

**Exemplo prático:** Se o IPCA acumulado for 12% no período, sua parcela e crédito sobem apenas 10%.
