**Formas de Pagar o Lance (Lance Livre e Lance Fixo):**

Não precisa ter todo o dinheiro do lance na hora! Você tem opções:

**1. Parcelamento em 4x sem juros:**
- Divide o lance em 4 parcelas
- O crédito é liberado após o pagamento da 4ª parcela
- Exemplo: Lance de R$ 8.000 = 4x de R$ 2.000

**2. Lance Embutido de 15%:**
- Use até 15% do próprio crédito como lance
- Não precisa de dinheiro extra
- Exemplo: Crédito de R$ 24.500 → pode usar até R$ 3.675 como lance

**3. Diluição de 100% do lance:**
- O valor do lance pode ser diluído nas parcelas vincendas
- Você não desembolsa de uma vez

**Lembrete:** Para o Lance Exclusivo, essas facilidades NÃO se aplicam - precisa ser pago com recursos próprios, sem parcelamento ou lance embutido.

**Dica:** Parcelas antecipadas pagas de forma espontânea também podem ser usadas como lance!
